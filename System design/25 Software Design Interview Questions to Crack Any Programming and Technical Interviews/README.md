Hello guys, If you have given any coding interview then you know that System design or Software design problems are an important part of programming job interviews, and if you want to do well, you must prepare this topic.


In the past, when I shared my list of [programming interview questions](http://www.java67.com/2018/05/top-75-programming-interview-questions-answers.html), I have shared a couple of[ System design questions](https://www.java67.com/2018/05/top-20-system-design-interview-questions-answers-programming.html) but my readers kept asking me for more questions, as it is a hard topic to master, and more and more practice is needed.


I had my own list of questions that I have collected from various interviews with friends and colleagues but I needed more questions for this article when I stumbled upon the [Grokking System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) course on

It's like a godsend resource because it not only gives you a lot of System design question but also provide all the knowledge and tools you need to solve those questions.


In other words, this course teaches you step by step how to proceed with designing a real-world system like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, etc.


Also, there are not too many system design interview courses and resources you can look to prepare this topic. When I was searching I only find Grokking The System Design course by Educative and [Preparing for the System Design Interview](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fpreparing-for-system-design-interviews%2F) course on 


[Udemy](https://medium.com/u/b32aa0132f1b?source=post_page-----4b8237942db0--------------------------------)


 by Rajat Mehta.


Other than that I didn't find any online course which is completely focused on solving system design problems from top companies like [Amazon](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/01/top-20-amazon-and-google-programming-interview-questions.html), [Google](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/01/google-interview-questions-answers-top.html), [Microsoft](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/12/30-microsoft-interview-questions-for-software-development-engineers.html#axzz5YWjgMMkL), Apple, SalesForce, Flipcart, etc.


When you combine this course with this list of questions you will have the best material to prepare for your [System design interview](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-system-design-courses-for-coding-interviews-949fd029ce65). You can also first try all these questions by yourself before joining the course or looking it my solution for some of the questions.


This works best only if you have some Coding experience and fundamental knowledge of Computer Science and Software Design. If you are a complete beginner in this area then I would suggest you first start with a fundamental course to learn basics like [Java Programming: Principles of Software Design](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fjava-programming-design-principles) on 


[Coursera](https://medium.com/u/99c0fb464c1f?source=post_page-----4b8237942db0--------------------------------)


 or the [Web Application & Software Architecture 101](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-application-software-architecture-101?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) on

This course will not only teach you how to solve a real-world problem using Java with multiple classes but also software design which is not just coding but also involves logical thinking and design, which is very important for becoming a successful Software Developer.


# Top 25 System Design Interview Questions for Programmers


Without any further ado, here is the list of some of the most popular System design or Object-oriented analysis and design questions to crack any programming job interview.


1. How do you design the Vending Machine in Java? ([solution](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/06/design-vending-machine-in-java.html#axzz4sZVwtCgs))\
You need to write code to implement a Vending machine that has a bunch of products like chocolates, candy, cold-drink, and accept some coins like Nickle, Dime, Quarter, Cent, etc. Make sure you insert a coin, get a product back, and get your chance back. Also, write the Unit test to demonstrate that these common use cases work. If you get stuck you can read my two-part articles ([part1](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/06/design-vending-machine-in-java.html#axzz4sZVwtCgs) and [part 2](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/06/java-object-oriented-analysis-and-design-vending-machine-part-2.html)) about solving these classical system design questions.


2. How do you design a URL Shortening service like goo.gl or bit.ly? ([solution](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR?affiliate_id=5073518643380224))\
This one is another common System design questions. You have given a (typically) long URL, how would you design a service that would generate a shorter and unique alias for it? If you are not familiar with URL shortener service have a look at some of the popular ones like goo.gl from Google and bit.ly which is used by Twitter.


Make sure to provide database schema and rationale behind some design decisions like how long you keep the data, how to get stats and analytics etc. If you get stuck, you can follow the solution given on [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) course on Educative.

3. How do you design a traffic control system?\
A classical system design question from old age which is still popular. Make sure you know how to transition from one state to another like RED to GREEN and from GREEN to ORANGE to RED etc.

4. How to design a limit order book for trading systems? ([solution](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/03/2-practical-data-structure-algorithm-interview-questions-java.html))\
A limit order book is used in stock exchanges to match a buy order with a sell order based on price and time priority. How would you go about that? Which data structure you will use? Remember, the speed of matching is key and also the reliability.


If you need a refresher on Data Structure then you can check out [Data Structure and Algorithm in Java](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearn-data-structure-algorithms-with-java-interview%2F) course and If you feel stuck you can check out my solution here.

5. How do you design a website like Pastebin?\
Pastebin allows you to paste text or code and then share a link to that code anywhere you want. It's not an online code editor but you can use this to store any kind of text.


## 6. How would you create your own Instagram? (solution)


Instagram is a photo-sharing application that provides some custom filters to enhance your photo quality. Your application should have photo upload functionality, tagging photos for search, and some basic filters. If you could add share or social network that could be great.


Btw, if you stuck, you can see the [free solution](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) provided on the

7. How do you design global file sharing and storage apps like Google Drive or Dropbox?\
These are used to store and share files, photos, and other media. How do you go about designing things like allowing users to upload/view/search/share files or photos? track permissions for file sharing, and allow multiple users to edit the same document?


If you like Youtube video, here is a nice one which will teach you how to design a Dropbox or Google Drive or any other document hosting solution:


## 8. How do you design a chat application like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger?


You have surely used WhatsApp and Facebook, right? No? If not let me tell you that a chat application allows you to send messages to your friend. It's a point to point connection.


You keep a friend list and see their status and chat with them. In WhatsApp, you can also connect groups but that is for advanced and experienced developers. At a minimum, you should provide a design to keep a friend list and send and receive messages from them.


If you need some tips then I suggest you check out [Preparing for the System Design Interview](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fpreparing-for-system-design-interviews%2F) Course on Udemy, where you will find a whole case study to solve this problem.
