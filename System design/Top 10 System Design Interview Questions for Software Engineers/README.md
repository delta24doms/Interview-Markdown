Given a (typically) long URL, how would how would you design service that would generate a shorter and unique alias for it.


Discuss things like:


* How to generate a unique ID for each URL?
* How would you generate unique IDs at scale (thousands of URL shortening requests coming every second)?
* How would your service handle redirects?
* How would you support custom short URLs?
* How to delete expired URLs etc?
* How to track click stats?


#### 2. Design YouTube, Netflix or Twitch (a¬†global video streaming service)


![](img/1-yo4vob7hdfdhcj9hhlactg-png)


Videos mean that your service will be storing and transmitting petabytes and petabytes of data.You should discuss how to efficiently store and distribute data in away that a huge number of users can watch and share them simultaneously (e.g. imagine streaming the latest episode of a hit TV show like Games of Thrones).


In addition, discuss:


* How would you record stats about videos e.g the total number of views, up-votes/down-votes, etc.
* How would a user add comments on videos (in realtime).


#### 3. Design Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp (a global chat¬†service)


![](img/1-yjghws5gzspmj4avaexfmq-png)


Interviewers are interested in knowing:


* How would you design one-on-one conversations between users?
* How would you extend your design to support group chats?
* What to do when the user is not connected to the internet?
* When to send push notifications?
* Can you provide end-to-end encryption. How?


#### 4. Designing Quora or Reddit or HackerNews (a social network + message board¬†service)


![](img/1-zbb6mn3n4e4j4htm2itfzg-png)


Users of the services can post questions or share links. Other users can answer questions or comment on the shared links. The service should be able to:


* Records stats for each answer e.g. the total number of views, upvotes/downvotes, etc.
* Users should be able to follow other users or topics
* Their timeline will consist of top questions from all the users and topics they follow (similar to newsfeed generation).


#### 5. Design Dropbox or Google Drive or Google Photos (a global file storage & sharing¬†service)


![](img/1-ya6zgbwwcmlm-yxet8ukka-png)


Discuss things like:


* How would users be able to upload/view/search/share files or photos?
* How would you track persmissions for file sharing
* How would you allow multiple users to edit the same document


#### 6. Design Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (a social media service with hundreds of millions of¬†users)


![](img/1-unzejgq6inp3tntpzrgx-q-png)


When designing a social medial service with hundreds of million (or billions of users), interviewers are interested in knowing how would you design the following components


* Efficient storage and search for posts or tweets.
* Newsfeed generation
* Social Graph (who befriends whom or who follows whom‚Ää---‚Ääspecially when millions of users are following a celebrity)


A lot of times, interviewers spend the whole interview discussing the design of the newsfeed.


#### 7.¬†Design Uber or Lyft (a ride sharing¬†service)


![](img/1-nabu7nflkrsuwxwu5nmqrw-png)


While designing a ride-sharing service, discuss things like:


* The most critical use case‚Ää---‚Ääwhen a customer requests a ride and how to efficiently match them with the nearby drivers?
* How to store millions of geographical locations for drivers and riders who are always moving.
* How to handle updates to driver/rider locations (millions of updates every second)?


#### 8. Design a Web Crawler or Type-Ahead (search engine related services)


![](img/1-gehhemz6b2xr3kzpfzrrka-png)


For Type-Ahead, as the user types in their query, you need to design a service which would suggest top 10 searched terms starting with whatever the user has typed. Discuss things like:


* How to store previous search queries?
* How to keep the data fresh?
* How to find the best matches to the already typed string?
* How to handle updates and the user is typing too fast?


For Web Crawler, we have to design a scalable service that can crawl the entire Web, and can fetch hundreds of millions of Web documents. Discuss things like:


* How to find new web pages?
* How to prioritize web pages that change dynamically?
* How to ensure that your crawler is not infinitely stuck on the same domain?


#### 9.¬†Design an API Rate Limiter (e.g. for Firebase or¬†Github)


![](img/1-tqgqqzhbv0qfi0bwkpuflq-png)


You are expected to develop a Rate Limiter services that can:


* Limit the number of requests an entity can send to an API within a time window e.g., 15 requests per second.
* The rate limiting should work for a distributed setup, as the APIs are accessible through a cluster of servers.
* How would you handle throttling (soft and hard throttling etc.).


#### 10. Design Yelp or¬†Nearby Places/Friends¬†(a proximity server)


![](img/1-bkfacfpwmy3kvmygd8r5sg-png)


This service would need to store locations for millions of people/places. Discuss things like:


* How would the users of the service be able to search nearby friends or places
* How to rank places (based on the distance, user reviews).
* How to efficiently store location data according to the population density (e.g. a block in New York City might have more places/people than a small city).
